Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to experiment with LLMs using the langchain framework. 

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Devs believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:
Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment
The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.

Here are some specific goals we aim to achieve:

Understanding LLMs: Gain a deeper understanding of Language Models and their capabilities. By experimenting with LLMs, understand their strengths and limitations.

Exploring Use Cases: We will explore various use cases where LLMs can be applied effectively. From text generation to conversational agents, we want to uncover the potential of LLMs in different domains.

Building Innovative Applications: By leveraging the langchain framework, build innovative applications that demonstrate the power and versatility of LLMs. Use applications will showcase the possibilities of using LLMs to solve real-world problems.
